Visio implementation not possible.
	vsdx: lack of documentation.
	Aspose: good god it's expensive (and trial testing failed)
Going to try flowchart.js, which requires the pyflowchart library.

Current proposed file structure:
root/
	.py files
	data/
		graduate.dat
		undergraduate.dat
	maps/
		[year]/
			Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.pdf
			Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.pdf
			etc.
		[year]/
			etc.

where [year] is a shortened representation of the first year (ex.: 2022-2023 would be 22)
to-do: automatic discovery of these files and recreating catalog classes. Directly pickling seems like it could be too much work for a class of this magnitude (that and the way the classes are laid out is not particularly conducive to this...)

12/20/2022
Moved old main into a new "old" folder, for old scripts - forgot to put this last time
Fixed issue #1 and implemented absolute paths... seems to be doing fine for now

12/13/2022
Pickle/file saving has been implemented on the subjects
New file for functions shared between all three scripts (just subjects and catalog for now): common.py
Add separate hour and level integer and string to courses
Courses very lazily try to split out prerequisites from their given description info*
Subject.populate now checks local cache first before going online
Subject.fetch is new, forces an online refresh and cache overwrite
Moved main.py integral code into main() function and call
main.py course test program made to display the additional information about courses as determined (level, hour, prereqs individually etc)

*only tested on ELEG 3103

12/11/2022
Split subject classes and catalog classes off into separate files.
main.py is now tiny! And each set of test things will be commented in and out

12/09/2022
Add functional support for graduate classes, not yet for masters degree catalogs
